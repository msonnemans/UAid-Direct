To provide direct help to those in Ukraine who do not have a choice in war. Our focus is on helping women and children that are often overlooked, neglected, vulnerable and unable to evacuate: orphanages, nursing homes, domestic violence shelters, safe homes and hospitals.Â 

We take food, medicine, hygiene supplies and clothing via the quickest and safest route into Ukraine, often able to deliver within 48-72 hours of receiving an order. As a completely volunteer-led effort, we use 100% of your donations to carry out our mission.
