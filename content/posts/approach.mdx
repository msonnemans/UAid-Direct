We work in three simple layers:

1. Requests, verification and prioritisation. Each request for help we receive is vetted by a dedicated team of four people with direct contacts in Ukraine. We ensure these are highest priority and their need for help is urgent.
2. Sourcing and storage. Once verified, each request is picked up by our dedicated sourcing team operating in Przemysl, Poland. We do our best to source from existing donations, but our work relies on your help with both goods and funding. 
3. Transport and follow up. Once our sourcing team is ready, the goods are labelled and loaded with one of our drivers. We use a network of trusted Ukrainian and international drivers.
