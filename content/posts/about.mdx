UAid Direct is a volunteer led group of like-minded individuals. As per our mission, we have determined a niche where we can be most effective. Some of our group have experience all over the world with various crisis situations, others have gained invaluable expertise and knowhow since the start of the war. 

The grateful recipients of UAid Direct are usually not visible and often go forgotten because they are in hiding. Some of our locations accumulate many refugees and therefore find it difficult or risky to evacuate, have doubled as mini hospitals, or do not have the support infrastructure to provide official requests to other larger humanitarian aid channels.

Our help so far has focused on two areas:

1. Medium sized cities close to the front lines: Cherkasy, Poltava and Dnipro. These act as hiding places for locals, hubs for internally displaced and distribution centres for smaller locations closer to the front.
2. Locations in western and central Ukraine: Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil and Drohobych. We support local communities who have been impacted by inflow of highly vulnerable people from within the country.
