The organization “On the Collision Line” ("На лінії зіткнення"), serves the people in Kramatorsk, Avdiivka, Svitlodarsk, Toretsk, Krasnohorivka.  Not everyone was able to flee the fighting in the Donbas area, the people who were left behind have had little help and it is very difficult to get food and supplies due to the heavy shelling of the area. The hospital in Yasnohirka (the part of Kramatorsk) is treating the people who could not evacuate. We delivered food for adults and babies, sanitary and hygiene supplies, and medicine and medical supplies. UAid Direct delivered to Ivano-Frankivsk, and the organization organized further transport to Kramatorsk.
