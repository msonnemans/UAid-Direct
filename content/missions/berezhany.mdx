Berezhany is located in Ternopil Oblast.  

A woman living there organized her fatherâ€™s small fleet of small trucks to evacuate families from the occupied territory and arranged for host families to house them in and around Berezhany.  
They constantly provide supplies to these families and she also has conducted aid deliveries to people in the Mykolaiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.  
This woman reached out to one of our volunteers and requested food, baby food, hygiene and sanitary supplies, basic medicines and medical supplies.
