A town in Zhytomyr Oblast has taken in about 750 displaced families.  Over 2300 people, including many elderly and disabled people, have sought a safe place to stay from the fighting in the East.  The town is close to the areas that were destroyed during the occupation of Northern Ukraine, so getting food and supplies for the town and its many additional displaced families has been difficult.  The town government requested food, and hygiene and sanitary supplies. Two trips were necessary to delivery all of the needed supplies.
