Cherkasy Social Orphanage cares for children of drug addicts, they are under state care, this type of orphanage is unable to evacuate due to the arrangements between the state and the parents.  They care for 72 orphans, plus 30 additional displaced people who had sought shelter at the orphanage, and the caregivers.  The orphanage approached UAid Direct through the network of orphanages.  Items requested were baby food and formula, diapers, food staples, hygiene supplies, basic medications and flashlights.   Through this orphanage, we were also able to deliver basic childrenâ€™s supplies to patients in a local hospital.

Further deliveries have resupplied the orphanage and provided for more displaced women and children who are being supported by the orphanage.
