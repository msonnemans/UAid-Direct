### 2. Donations of goods in any quantities

- non-perishable food
- medicine & medical supplies
- hygiene and domestic cleaning products
- winter items: generators, heaters & sleeping bags

### 3. Financial donations

- £10,000 = medicines for 4-5 locations
- £1,500-2,000 = a van load of emergency provisions for liberated areas
- £1,100 = 1,000,000L worth of water purification tablets
- £400 = monthly cost of warehouse rental
- £1,000-1,500 = monthly fuel expenses and vehicle maintenance for our volunteers

### 4. In person help
